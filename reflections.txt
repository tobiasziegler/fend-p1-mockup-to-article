You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

1. Because I have worked with HTML before this has mostly covered things I already knew how to do, but learning to use the Mozilla documentation to find the right markup has been a good skill to pick up.

2. Most things have been pretty easy so far, but attention to detail has been the key.

3. Avoiding making small errors (not closing tags properly, etc.), and making choices when multiple different elements could apply (e.g., in this project the strikethrough could have been an <s> element or <del>).

4. I've made sure to start working at things and getting one part of each task to work, using trial and error and testing along the way.
